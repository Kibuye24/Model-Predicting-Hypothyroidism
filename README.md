# Model-Predicting-Hypothyroidism
### Python Programmming Data Science Project, February, 2022
#### By **Kibuye**
## Description
We are looking at the main factors that contribute to hypothyroidism. From that, we create a classification model that will predict from features whether a person has hypothyroid or not. We will use random forest classifications (ABA Booster and Gradient Boost classifiers). We also use SVM while changing the kernel parameters to see which model is best to use.
## Research Question:
Build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook.
